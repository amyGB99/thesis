    abstract="The ChaLearn AutoML Challenge (The authors are in alphabetical order of last name, except the first author who did most of the writing and the second author who produced most of the numerical analyses and plots.) (NIPS 2015 -- ICML 2016) consisted of six rounds of a machine learning competition of progressive difficulty, subject to limited computational resources. It was followed bya one-round AutoML challenge (PAKDD 2018). The AutoML setting differs from former model selection/hyper-parameter selection challenges, such as the one we previously organized for NIPS 2006: the participants aim to develop fully automated and computationally efficient systems, capable of being trained and tested without human intervention, with code submission. This chapter analyzes the results of these competitions and provides details about the datasets, which were not revealed to the participants. The solutions of the winners are systematically benchmarked over all datasets of all rounds and compared with canonical machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn. All materials discussed in this chapter (data and code) have been made publicly available at http://automl.chalearn.org/.",

This data driven competition asked participants to develop computer programs capable of solving supervised learning problems where the i.i.d. assumption did not hold. Large data sets were arranged in a lifelong learning and evaluation scenario and CodaLab was used as the challenge platform. The challenge attracted more than 300 participants in its 2 months duration. This chapter describes the design of the challenge and summarizes its main results.",

    abstract = {Automated machine learning (AutoML) offers the promise of translating raw data into accurate predictions without the need for significant human effort, expertise, and manual experimentation. In this lecture-style tutorial, we demonstrate fundamental techniques that powers up multimodal AutoML. Different from most AutoML systems that focus on solving tabular tasks that contain categorical and numerical features, we consider supervised learning tasks on various types of data including tabular features, text, and image, as well as their combinations. Rather than technical descriptions of how individual ML models work, we emphasize how to best use models within an overall ML pipeline that takes in raw training data and outputs predictions for test data. A major focus of our tutorial is on automatically building and training deep learning models, which are powerful yet cumbersome to manage manually. Hardly any educational material describes their successful automation. Each topic covered in the tutorial is accompanied by a hands-on Jupyter notebook that implements best practices (which will be available on GitHub before and after the tutorial). Most of the code is adopted from AutoGluon (https://auto.gluon.ai/), a recent open-source AutoML toolkit that is both state-of-the-art and easy-to-use.},

  abstract  = {Training of neural networks requires often high computational power and large memory on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) hardware. Many cloud providers such as Ama­zon, Azure, Google, Siemens, etc, provide such infrastructure. However, should one choose a cloud infrastructure or an on premise system for a neural network application, how can these systems be compared with one another? This paper investigates seven prominent Machine Learning benchmarks, which are MLPerf, DAWNBench, DeepBench, DLBS, TBD, AIBench, and ADABench. The recent popularity and widespread use of Deep Learning in various applications have created a need for bench­marking in this field. This paper shows that these application domains need slightly different resources and argue that there is no standard benchmark suite available that addresses these different application needs. We compare these benchmarks and summarize benchmark­related datasets, domains, and metrics. Finally, a concept of an ideal benchmark is sketched.},

    abstract="As data science becomes increasingly mainstream, there will be an ever-growing demand for data science tools that are more accessible, flexible, and scalable. In response to this demand, automated machine learning (AutoML) researchers have begun building systems that automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter we present TPOT v0.3, an open source genetic programming-based AutoML system that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification task. We benchmark TPOT on a series of 150 supervised classification tasks and find that it significantly outperforms a basic machine learning analysis in 21 of them, while experiencing minimal degradation in accuracy on 4 of the benchmarks---all without any domain knowledge nor human input. As such, genetic programming-based AutoML systems show considerable promise in the AutoML domain.",
